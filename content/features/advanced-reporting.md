A [recent survey by Aberdeen Group](http://aberdeen.com/research/8815/rr-embedded-business-intelligence/content.aspx), shows that 73% of ISVs include reporting and analytics in their software as a basis to differentiate their products and develop competitive advantage. Other reasons include improving end-user experience and increasing average customer value.

If system logs are for developers and [audit logs](../audit-log/) are for admin record keeping then reporting is for business. In other words, data related to the business purpose of the application, not the nuts and bolts.  

Advanced reporting is an important feature for enterprise buyers because it allows them (or the administrator) to prove that the software in itself was effective (justifying the price they paid).  It isn’t enough for software to be effective, it has to be provably effective. The more ways you enable customers to slice and manipulate the data that your application produces, the more likely that they’ll be able to prove effectiveness and derive value from your apps.

Reporting and analytics can also affect the bottom line, SaaS companies [ can charge](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ditch-the-data-dump) 8x more per user for an edition that includes advanced analytics, compared to basic reporting. The better the analytics in your app, the better the insights that people glean from them and the better valued the tool. 

## Types of Functionality Offered
Consider adding basic reporting functionality to your entry-level [product editions](../features/product-assortment/) and more advanced analytics functionality to your more advanced editions. Enterprises have more complex data requirements, more types of users and will be more demanding in this respect.

### Static Canned Reporting and Data Dumps
At the most basic level you need reporting, including usage reporting. Reporting tells your customer what happened in a pre-formatted layout. Make sure that this can be dumped to Excel. Many of these are the same core usage stats that you’re likely tracking internally to understand if your product is successful as a whole, segmented for individual customers. The more charts/graphs you provide the better the story that your customer can tell inside the organization. Static reporting means that you are having to generate all possibilities for canned reports - with basic parametrization. Usually this isn't enough to satisfy enterprise customers. 

### Interactive Reporting and Dashboards
Interactive reporting and dashboards adds on to your canned reports with interactivity and a library or pre-canned widgets. These widgets tend to track KPIs and are arranged in dashboards. This is moving up the data-pipeline - with canned reports the data is generally "raw" and immutable where interactivity adds a layer of customization. Enterprise tools tend to have many users and allowing customization gives you a higher chance of pleasing more.   

### Self-Service Authoring, Data Exploration and Analytics 
The next level is analytics. Analytics gives your customers the ability to ask their own questions (as opposed to canned reports and dashboards). Analytics generally go deeper than how the product is being used. Instead, analytics gives your customer key insights into their business based on the data that your application collects.

### Typical Features Enterprises Want
 * Schedule/Email reports
 * Alerts on exceptions
 * Export to different formats (e.g. Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
 * Row/Column level security on data and permissions management on reports
 * Blend external data
 * Data level export for use in 3rd party analytics tools
 
Reporting and analytics embedded into enterprise applications can differentiate products and are expected by enterprise buyers. A guide by O'Reilly Media titled [Embedding Analytics into Modern Applications](http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/embedding-analytics-in-modern-applications.csp) covers several approaches.
