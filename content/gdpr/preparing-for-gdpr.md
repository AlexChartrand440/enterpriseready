Sometimes the best way to get a sense of something—especially something as complex as GDPR—is to see how your peers are thinking about it. Here’s a collection of documents that some of the most-successful cloud and SaaS providers have put together to explain how they plan to comply with the law; the requirements they have in place for customers and subprocessors; and also their lists of subprocessors that handle personal data.

While all this information is useful for people learning about GDPR, posting it publicly also allows companies to answer any questions their customers (or potential customers) might have in a scalable manner. Typically, SaaS providers will include at least the following content as part of explaining their GDPR compliance:

* Overview of GDPR, including what they’re doing to comply and help their customers comply.
* Data Processing Addendum/Amendment/Agreement (DPA) laying out their contractual relationships and liabilities with customers in the context of GDPR.
* A list of processors and/or subprocessors that process data on their behalf. This includes IaaS providers, support vendors and anyone else that stores or otherwise processes customers’ personal data.

If you’re a SaaS provider and want to add your information, or if you’ve come across some particularly useful information, please drop us a line [LINK] or make a pull request.
