Perhaps you’ve read our introduction to GDPR for SaaS companies [LINK] and decided you want to learn more, or perhaps you’ve already been thinking about GDPR but haven’t spent a lot of time analyzing what it might mean for your company. Here, we try to take things a little deeper, looking at some of the core concepts of GDPR compliance and how they might apply to SaaS companies, specifically.

Because there’s still much ambiguity in terms of exactly how certain aspects will be defined and adjudicated in practice, there are places where we present more questions than we do answers. However, it’s nonetheless important to be thinking about these topics and how you’ll address them, both technologically and contractually with your customers, vendors and partners.
