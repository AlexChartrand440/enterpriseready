## Types of contributions we're looking for
First and foremost, this project is a forum to discuss open source best practices, then document them in a guide when we've found consensus.

You can do so under [Issues](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/issues).

There are also many ways you can directly contribute to the guides (in descending order of need):

* Fix editorial inconsistencies or inaccuracies
* Add stories, examples, or anecdotes that help illustrate a point
* Revise language to be more approachable and friendly
* Translate guides into other languages

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. 
* When adding content, please consider if is widely valuable and not directed solely towards self-promotion of you or your company. 

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/enterpriseready/enterpriseready/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of Enterprise Ready, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, **or self-contained,** such as writing a translation, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Content Principles 

Scaling a SaaS product to the enterprise is hard. Good content can help solve problems. 

Enterprise Ready aims to help SaaS companies solve problems around scaling to the enterprise before they start, through content containing best practices and lessons learned from like-industry companies past and present.

We are product people solving problems with content. For Enterprise Ready, content *is* our product and ultimately important.

## Content Principles
All Enterprise Ready content aims to be:

* **Approachable:** Don't assume reader has prior knowledge, spell out acronyms, establish understanding before deep diving.
* **Informative:** 
* **Supported by Curated Examples:** Amplify best practices and lessons to learn (pros/cons) from existing SaaS products vs. opinions or individual point of views. 

## Referencing Industry Examples (WIP)

Enterprise Ready uses real examples from the SaaS industry to illustrate best practices. When referencing another company's model for a given topic, please follow these guidelines.

* Include company logo and link 

## Capitalization (WIP)

"Enterprise Ready" should be capitalized when referred to as a resource.
