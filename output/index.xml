      <description>Expensify is an expense reporting tool that started by targeting SMBs and startups, but has grown with its customers (which includes the likes of Uber, Square, Snapchat, Stripe, GitHub, Docker and Zendesk) into a nearly complete enterprise ready application.
Product Assortment with Integrations As part of its evolution, Expensify now integrates into a variety of accounting products. However, recognizing that those accounting products generally target different types of buyers, they&amp;rsquo;ve decided to create product assortment by feature-gating various integrations.</description>

      <description>Facebook launched its Workplace product into private beta at the end of 2016. The product is targeted at large organizations who are looking for a user friendly &amp;amp; familiar application for knowledge sharing and communication. Out of the gate, the product includes several enterprise ready features including team management, product security, advanced SSO, minimal RBAC, and detailed reports. We&amp;rsquo;ll review the reporting functionality and assess its enterprise readiness.
The good Like many of the features of Workplace, it is evident that this was built to meet the internal needs of Facebook (the company/organization).</description>

      <description>GitHub offers their Enterprise customers additional features for reporting that are not available in standard editions. Because GitHub is a tool for code management, the intended audience is almost always technical, so GitHub have the advantage of being able to offer their data access in fairly complex ways like APIs. A tool that is geared towards teachers would not get away with offering most of data access in the form of APIs and would likely have to spend more development cycles providing reports.</description>

      <description>HubSpot&amp;rsquo;s products are about end-to-end demand generation and lead management. Marketing is a role that requires a lot of analytics and marketing people tend to be less technical. This means that in order to provide data to eyeballs the ability to let users define their own reports and analytics is critical.
Product Assortment The three plans that HubSpot offers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) are interesting to study from an analytics assortment point of view - clearly some thought went into how the plans are designed.</description>

      <description>Work in progress I think that a broad definition of Hybrid Cloud is&amp;hellip; you run a consumer website&amp;hellip; you host your application in a data center where you control the servers, but you have the ability to &amp;ldquo;burst&amp;rdquo; onto a public cloud for excess capacity. This feels less relevant for software you purchase. This is possible with privately hosted SaaS applications but not that common.

      <description>The evolution of enterprise software has changed the landscape for how applications are adopted and deployed. Below are the most common methods for delivering applications to customers.
Multi-tenant (vendor managed) Most SaaS applications today are built to be deployed as a multi-tenant application that is managed and operated by the application vendor. This deployment model was pioneered by Salesforce as “on-demand” and has led to the modern software landscape we’re familiar with today.</description>

      <description>Box is a file sharing and collaboration tool that has built its business on enabling enterprise companies to transition away from legacy shared drive systems, to the cloud-hosted Box platform. Along the way Box has faced a never-ending string of objections from potential buyers in the areas of security. As a result, Box has continued to create demonstrable security practices and the marketing campaigns to promote their objectives.
Box focuses heavily on Security as a core feature of their product, this can be seen clearly in their security page:</description>

      <description>Audit logs are the centralized stream of all user activity within a team. Part of the security and compliance program of any large enterprise is designed to control and monitor the access of information within the organization. This drives the need for enterprise buyers to ask for a detailed audit trail of all activity that happens within their account. An audit trail can be used to prevent suspicious activity when it starts (if actively monitored), or to play back account activity during an incident review.</description>

      <description>The operational procedures of many large enterprise organizations generally encourage adherence to written change management policies. For SaaS vendors embracing these procedures means integrating with change controls. There are two different layers to change management SaaS vendors should consider from a product perspective: 1) application level updates to product made by the SaaS vendor 2) account level updates to settings and configurations.
Application level change management Enterprises will often set up workflows around your product.</description>

      <description>EnterpriseReady was created for the people who build SaaS products, that&amp;rsquo;s why it was important to get contributors from the teams who are building the leading SaaS products. We&amp;rsquo;ve all experienced the bumpy road to finding enterprise adoption, a lot of the bumps were making our applications more Enterprise Ready. Enterprise Ready is the culmination of all of our efforts to help more SaaS vendors find success in the Enterprise.</description>

      <description>As discussed in our overview of the various deployment options that are available to SaaS vendors, many large enterprises will ask for a private instance of an application. They might be looking for a single tenant instance that you host and manage. Or they might be looking for a full on-prem, air-gapped server installation… or anything in between. Ultimately, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to be able to deliver a version of your application that can be deployed anywhere.</description>

      <description>The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect on May 25, 2018, and is rife with provisions that will impact the way in which SaaS vendors and their customers interact with each other. While it might be a big win for private citizens seeking some sovereignty over their personal information, it will undoubtedly make life at least a little trickier for every company doing business in the EU, employing EU citizens, handling the personal data of European citizens or doing business with companies who do business in the EU.</description>

      <description>GitHub offers their application to customers with a few different deployment options. The vast majority of GitHub&amp;rsquo;s customers run on GitHub.com (in terms of quantity, but not necessarily in terms of revenue), this is the multi-tenant, cloud hosted version of their application. Individuals sign up for accounts and then are added to organizations when they join a new company. Organizations will generally have a mix of private and public repos with varying access based on the users role.</description>

      <description>Google Apps for Work provides a robust audit trail to both Standard and Unlimited accounts. By default, the feature is only available to Admins. Non-admin users have no way to view their personal audit history. Google categorizes their audit trail as a type of report, so it is available under the Reports menu.
For the Standard Plan, audit logs are available for Admin activities, Logins, Calendar activities, Tokens, Groups, and Email log search.</description>

      <description>Google Apps for Work is the business focused version of the popular and free to consumers, Google Apps products shown below:
All of these products can be used for free by just creating a Gmail account, however the free version lacks all of the EnterpriseReady features.
Unlike many other SaaS applications, there is no upgrade path from the free version to a paid account. In order to use Google Apps for Work a company administrator must register an organization and either buy or prove ownership of a domain name they’d like to use with the service.</description>

      <description>HashiCorp sells a portfolio of popular infrastructure automation and security products, including Terraform, Vault, Consul and Nomad. It also offers open source versions of these products and others (Vagrant and Packer), and it ties support levels directly to the tier of product that’s being used.
HashiCorp keeps its product tiers simple, so it’s easy to see what level of support you’ll get with each. As you can see with Terraform, for example, the free open source version doesn’t have any HashiCorp-provided support (beyond the community and documentation, that is), while Pro and Premium offer Silver- and Gold-level support, respectively.</description>

      <description>Team functionality drives collaboration, which is why Heroku introduced Teams for people to build and collaborate on apps together.
User Centric vs. Team Centric? User Centric. Enterprise Ready classifies Team functionality into to camps, User Centric vs. Team Centric. You can read more in depth on this concept but quickly it’s the model for how applications group users to create teams. Applications like Github follow the User Centric approach, everybody on Github has their own user account that gets assigned to organizations.</description>

      <description>HubSpot introduced roles &amp;amp; permissions about 4 years ago. In doing so, they enabled their customers to provide role based access control to application functionality.
What they do well: Documentation: They’ve done a nice job of clearly documenting the permissions assigned to each role.
Integration with user invitation flow As an account admin you select the role of the user as step 2 of the invite flow:
Sane defaults Account permissions that would potentially give the user full access are separated from the standard roles and are defaulted to non-admin status (reducing the likelihood of just moving ahead with defaults and making many admins).</description>

 Enterprises are complex entities composed of a variety of teams and the applications they like to use. These applications generate valuable business data that, when sent to other tools or combined with other data, is far more useful. For these enterprises to reduce organizational communication overhead and maintain business agility, it’s integral for those applications to be able to work together.</description>

      <description>Intercom is an application to communicate with your customers. Because so many people within an organization would need access to an application like this it was important that Intercom introduced Role Based Access Controls or user permissions.
Types of Permissions: For each team member Intercom allows you to choose whether they have access to things like app settings, billing, user data, or native to the Intercom app the ability to send / edit manual messages and auto messages.</description>

      <description>Product assortment is the method by which SaaS companies create different product packages to appeal to different buyer segments. This is most evident on SaaS pricing pages where plans are listed as “Startup”, “Professional” and “Enterprise.” Often those plans differ in terms of the features offered, the level of support provided, and the price charged for the product or service.
In general, the features that differentiate the “Startup” and “Enterprise” pricing plans and create product assortment are the same features that define EnterpriseReady.</description>

      <description>Security isn&amp;rsquo;t a topic to discuss by itself, it should be part of the conversation around everything discussed on EnterpriseReady. For SaaS companies working with larger enterprise IT buyers it is incredibly important for this to be an area of strength. Most enterprises will provide potential software vendors with long third-party vendor security questionnaires. These documents generally cover a broad range of security topics including product security, physical office security, employee screening, office network security, business continuity, upstream vendor security, disaster recovery, data security, secure IT policy, asset security and data center security in order to evaluate the overall security posture of an organization.</description>

      <description>Reporting and analytics embedded into enterprise applications can differentiate products and are expected by many enterprise buyers. The more people using your application, the more functionality in reporting they will want. Consider a simple CRM app - if you sell it to small sales teams then only the sales department will want a couple of simple pipeline reports. If you sold it to an enterprise you&amp;rsquo;ll have different tiers of sales managers, lead developers, marketing, finance, support staff and many more.</description>

      <description>Role based access control (RBAC) functionality enables application admins to limit the permissions of some users within a team.
Many times when SaaS applications first launch team functionality, they start out with all users being fully privileged to access all features. However, for larger customers there are requirements that different members of the team be assigned only the functionality they need to do their job (see the principle of least privilege).</description>

      <description>Segment is an enterprise SaaS solution that helps companies simplify their analytics. In 2011, the founders came across an engineering pain of writing redundant tracking code to send customer behavioral events to Google Analytics, MixPanel, and KISSmetrics. A few months later, analytics.js, an analytics wrapper library, was conceived.
It became evident the value of having the same, consistent customer data across all the tools that rely on them. Now, Segment supports over 200 different marketing and analytics tools, as well as data warehousing services such as Redshift and BigQuery.</description>

      <description>Single Sign On (SSO) allows your customers to manage their team’s users outside of your built-in user table. SSO centralizes the database of users into a single service that controls authorization to all accounts and applications.
Enterprises use a large number of services with a large number of end users. It nearly impossible to manage hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of users across tens or hundreds of different applications.</description>

      <title>SLA and Support</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/features/sla-support/</guid>
      <description>SLA (Service Level Agreement) Service level agreements are a common request from enterprise customers, rooted in the twin premises that (1) if they spend a lot of money on a product, they expect a certain level of quality, and (2) that due to the scale of their businesses, unplanned outage can cost them non-trivial amounts of money. Typically, SLAs guarantee a minimum amount of application uptime and/or a maximum wait time for resolving support issues.</description>

      <description>Slack was quite proactive in preparing for the European Commission’s enactment of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), seemingly doing everything that is required to comply with the law and also to inform customers about how Slack will help them comply. This is includes table-stakes efforts such as creating a dedicated GDPR website and entering into Data Processing Addenda with both its customers and its vendors.
In order to reassure customers that their data will be safe with Slack, and that their use of Slack complies with GDPR guidelines, Slack also uses its GDPR website to highlight its security certifications and practices, as well as its certification under both the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks.</description>

      <description>Slack leverages vertical product assortment to create different packages that meet the needs of different customer segments. The packages are primarily defined by the features they add. Just like most SaaS applications, those features generally fall into the EnterpriseReady feature categories as illustrated below.
The Free tier limits the quantity of integrations, searchable messages and file storage space. If any threshold is hit then the price bumps up to $8 per user per month.</description>

      <description>Slack supports a variety of different login options: standard user-based login, OAuth login with Google Accounts, or SAML login. Slack also has managed to provide a good process to converting an account from one login system to another.
On the administration page of a Slack team, there is an option to select Google Apps or SAML. It should be noted that Slack has different pricing tiers and the middle tier allows you to access the Google Apps login option, and you must be on the highest tier to access the SAML option.</description>

      <description>Slack has done a remarkable job keeping up with its fast growth, and that extends to how the company has implemented its customer support and SLA offerings. Generally speaking, Slack handles support exactly how you might think it would: the more money you pay, the higher level of support you get. In the Slack for Teams product, free plans get standard support, mid-tier plans get priority support, and the highest tier (called Plus) receives 24&amp;frasl;7 support.</description>

      <description>Square isn’t the typical enterprise software company that we look to for great implementation of EnterpriseReady features. Their flagship product is a Point of Sale (PoS) targeted for small and medium sized businesses. You’ll probably find one of these at your local coffee shop or food truck. But they’ve since built a suite of software products that aim to go beyond just helping merchants accept a credit card, including their Employee Management product that provides time cards and other HR type features.</description>

      <description>Teams describes the functionality that enables modern software to be collaborative and managed. Through Teams, app users invite others to collaboratively use the application with them by creating or linking an account. Apps that don’t have team functionality often require password sharing for multiple users to access the account, which is an obvious security hurdle for most business users.
The fact that it needs to be included as a critical, EnterpriseReady feature underscores the importance of consumer software with enterprise users (see Gmail, Dropbox, Evernote, 1Password).</description>

      <description>GitHub and Gmail each had significant traction with individual users before their products were widely adopted by enterprises. They each took slightly different approaches to how teams would be implemented as a result.
GitHub Teams GitHub started by allowing individual users to create organizations through which they can invite existing GitHub users. For GitHub, if your company uses their hosted private repos, then your personal account is granted access to your company’s organization.</description>

      <description>The Zendesk audit log is available only to Enterprise level customers. It includes the basic audit logging features in that it tracks Who, What, When and Where. However, it lacks many of the features that make audit logs a critical enterprise ready feature.
The Good: Retroactive Audit Record The first thing you’ll notice if you enable it for an active account is that it does have a historical record of the audit events from the accounts inception (no matter what account type you started with).</description>

      <description>Zendesk enables customers who purchase the enterprise plan to leverage their Sandbox feature for change management.
The good Admin users are all permissioned to access the new account automatically (though if you use some type of SSO for authentication you’ll need to use the reset password flow in order to login).
It is easy to create a sandbox environment from their UI. Just click a button and you can create a new environment or reset it back to its original settings.</description>
