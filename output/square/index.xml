      <description>Square isn’t the typical enterprise software company that we look to for great implementation of EnterpriseReady features. Their flagship product is a Point of Sale (PoS) targeted for small and medium sized businesses. You’ll probably find one of these at your local coffee shop or food truck. But they’ve since built a suite of software products that aim to go beyond just helping merchants accept a credit card, including their Employee Management product that provides time cards and other HR type features.</description>
